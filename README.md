# SDS011-Android
This Repo contains a manual and python3 code to set up a SDS011 particulate sensor connected with the HC-06 bluetooth module under Android. The measurements are presented in a QPython 3L WebApp using the Python web framework bottle. It is heavily influenced by https://github.com/optiprime/Feinstaubsensor However optiprimes code is not working under python3.x. The urge to get the setup running with Qpython 3L led to this repository.
